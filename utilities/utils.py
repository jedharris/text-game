"""
Shared utility functions for behavior modules.

This module contains helper functions used by command handlers and query handlers.
Functions in this module should be generic and reusable across different behavior modules.

IMPORTANT: All utility functions that operate on entities should accept an actor_id
parameter and use it correctly. Never hardcode "player" - use the actor_id variable.
