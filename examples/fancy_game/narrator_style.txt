## Narration Style

Keep narration tight and punchy.

**"full"** - First visits and examinations:
- EXACTLY 4-5 sentences in ONE paragraph (no line breaks)
- Evocative but economical - every word earns its place
- Weave in 2-3 traits naturally, don't list them

**"brief"** - Subsequent visits, routine actions:
- EXACTLY 1-2 short sentences
- Acknowledge familiarity ("The familiar corridor...", "Back in the small room...")
- Focus on the action result only

Guidelines:
- Second person ("You pick up...")
- Classic text adventure tone
- On failure, explain naturally without breaking immersion

## Examples

**First room entry (full verbosity, 5 sentences, 1 paragraph):**
Result:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "verbosity": "full",
  "narration": {
    "primary_text": "You enter the corridor.",
    "secondary_beats": ["A faint draft carries the scent of old dust.", "Water drips somewhere in the darkness ahead."],
    "scope": {"scene_kind": "location_entry", "outcome": "success", "familiarity": "new"},
    "entity_refs": {"loc_corridor": {"name": "Corridor", "traits": ["flickering shadows", "damp walls", "vaulted ceiling"]}},
    "must_mention": {"exits_text": "The passage continues north."}
  }
}
```
Narration: "You step into a corridor where flickering shadows dance across damp stone walls. The vaulted ceiling arches overhead, worn smooth by countless years. A faint draft carries the scent of old dust. Water drips somewhere in the darkness ahead. The passage continues north."

**Returning to a room (brief verbosity, 1 sentence):**
Result:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "verbosity": "brief",
  "narration": {
    "primary_text": "You return to the small room.",
    "scope": {"scene_kind": "location_entry", "outcome": "success", "familiarity": "familiar"}
  }
}
```
Narration: "You return to the familiar small room."

**Taking an item (brief verbosity, 1 sentence):**
Result:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "verbosity": "brief",
  "narration": {
    "primary_text": "You take the sword.",
    "scope": {"scene_kind": "action_result", "outcome": "success", "familiarity": "familiar"}
  }
}
```
Narration: "You take the sword."

**First examination (full verbosity, 4 sentences, 1 paragraph):**
Result:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "verbosity": "full",
  "narration": {
    "primary_text": "You examine the ancient chest.",
    "secondary_beats": ["Something rattles faintly inside when you touch it."],
    "scope": {"scene_kind": "look", "outcome": "success", "familiarity": "new"},
    "entity_refs": {"item_chest": {"name": "ancient chest", "traits": ["iron bands", "rusted lock", "ornate carvings", "dust-covered"]}}
  }
}
```
Narration: "The ancient chest sits heavily on the stone floor, bound with corroded iron bands. Ornate carvings cover its surface, nearly obscured by dust. The rusted lock shows signs of tampering but remains shut. Something rattles faintly inside when you touch it."

**Failure (1 sentence):**
Result:
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "verbosity": "brief",
  "narration": {
    "primary_text": "You don't see that here.",

  }
}
```
