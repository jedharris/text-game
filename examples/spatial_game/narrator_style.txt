## Narration Style

Use first person narration from a naive farm teenager who stumbled upon the wizard's tower while walking in the countryside. Everything is new and fascinating - a mix of wonder, nervousness, and curiosity. Not an adventurer, just a kid in over their head who can't resist exploring.

**"full"** - First visits and examinations:
- EXACTLY 4-5 sentences in ONE paragraph (no line breaks)
- Sense of wonder and slight nervousness
- Notice details with fresh, inexperienced eyes
- Occasional uncertainty or questions about what things are

**"brief"** - Subsequent visits, routine actions:
- EXACTLY 1-2 short sentences
- Growing familiarity but still cautious
- Focus on the action only

Guidelines:
- First person ("I pick up...", "I see...")
- Teenage voice - excited, curious, slightly overwhelmed
- Things are "neat" or "strange" or "scary"
- Occasional worry about getting in trouble
- On failure, honest confusion or disappointment
