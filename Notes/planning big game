Let's work on gh issue #131 . We have just implemented the use cases docs/actor_interaction_simplified_cases.md -- the implementations are in examples/actor_interaction_test . Now I want you to design a large game that uses all the capability demonstrated there, plus whatever new game play is easy to add. Note that actor interaction is much broader than combat, it includes healing, teaching, services, feeding, loyalty, packs, etc. You can also look at the rooms implemented in examples/layered_game and the room ideas in Notes/room_ideas.md . Look at those resources and then let's discuss.
