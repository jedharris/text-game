# Myconid Elder Dialog Trust System
# Tests dialog-based trust progression through asking about topics

# Navigate to myconid sanctuary
go west
go down
go east

# Part 1: Test initial dialog without trust
# Ask about resistance - requires trust >= 2, should be unavailable
ask elder about resistance

# Part 2: Build trust through dialog
# Ask about cure - has trust_delta: 1
ask elder about cure

# Part 3: Ask about cure again to increase trust to 2
ask elder about cure

# Part 4: Now resistance topic should be available
ask elder about resistance

# SUCCESS: Dialog trust system validated!
# - Topics with trust_delta increase trust when discussed
# - Topics with requires_trust gate properly
# - Trust progression through dialog works
