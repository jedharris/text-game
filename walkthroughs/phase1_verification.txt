# Phase 1 Verification Walkthrough
# Tests the three critical fixes:
# 1. Stand/sit handler includes entity_refs with traits
# 2. Must_mention doesn't leak field names
# 3. Exits only mentioned on first visit or explicit look

# Test 1: Stand on bench should have entity_refs with bench traits

✓ SUCCESS

# Test 2: First movement north should include exits (first visit)

# Test 3: Return south (familiar location - no exits in must_mention)

✓ SUCCESS

# Test 4: Go north again (familiar - no exits)

✓ SUCCESS

# Test 5: Explicit look always includes exits
