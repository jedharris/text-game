[✓] Nexus Chamber
The heart of the meridian convergence, a vast circular chamber where reality itself seems to bend. At the center stands the damaged waystone, its surface cracked and dim. Twilight suffuses the space from no visible source. Exits lead north to the frozen passes, south to the forest edge, east to flooded ruins, and west to dark caverns. A stairway spirals upward to an observatory.

Also here: Waystone

Exits: north (north), south (south), east (east), west (west), up (up)

============================================================
> go north
------------------------------------------------------------
[✓] You go north north to Frozen Pass.

Frozen Pass
The entrance to the Frozen Reaches, where an eternal winter has gripped the land. Cold wind howls through the pass, carrying flurries of snow. The temperature drops noticeably as you move away from the nexus. An abandoned camp sits to one side, half-buried in snow, its former occupants frozen where they fell.

You see: cold weather gear, preserved supplies, partial map
In the preserved supplies: dried meat, bandages, ancient torch

Exits: south (south), north (north), east (east), west (west), northwest (northwest)

============================================================
> go east
------------------------------------------------------------
[✓] You go east east to Ice Caves.

Ice Caves
Crystal blue walls of ice surround you, refracting light into dancing patterns. Your breath freezes instantly in the frigid air. The cave extends deeper into the glacier - a main chamber with ice crystals growing from the walls, a deep section where frozen pools lie still, and hints of hidden passages in the shadows. The floor makes ominous cracking sounds underfoot.

You see: frost lily, ice shard, crystal lens, control crystal

Exits: west (west), north (north)
