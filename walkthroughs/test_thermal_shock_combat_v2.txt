# Thermal Shock Combat Walkthrough (v2)
#
# Tests the temperature-based damage system and state-dependent guardian blocking.
#
# Expected flow:
# 1. Get fire wand from temple (guardians block only "up" in guarding state)
# 2. Navigate to ice caves and get ice wand
# 3. Return to temple and enter combat with golems
# 4. Defeat both golems using thermal shock alternating attacks
# 5. Access observatory (guardians no longer blocking)

# Navigate to temple sanctum (from nexus_chamber)
go north
go north
look

# Take fire wand - guardians should allow this (non-hostile)
take fire wand

# Test that guardians block "up" but allow "south" in guarding state
go south

# Navigate to ice caves to get ice wand
go east
look

# Use fire wand to melt ice wand (optional flavor interaction)
use fire wand on ice wand
take ice wand
inventory

# Return to temple sanctum with both wands
go west
go north
look

# Take cover behind stone pillar before combat
cover behind pillar

# Attack golem to initiate combat (both golems become hostile)
attack guardian

# Thermal shock sequence - defeat first guardian
# Fire vs neutral = 10 damage, golem becomes HOT
attack guardian with fire wand

# Ice vs hot = THERMAL SHOCK! 30 damage, golem becomes COLD
attack guardian with ice wand

# Continue alternating for thermal shock
attack guardian with fire wand
attack guardian with ice wand
attack guardian with fire wand
attack guardian with ice wand

# First golem destroyed (150 HP / 30 damage per thermal shock = 5-6 hits)
# Second golem now becomes target

# Attack second golem (starts at neutral temperature)
# Fire vs neutral = 10 damage (no thermal shock on first hit)
attack guardian with fire wand

# Now alternate for thermal shock (30 damage each)
# Need 140 more damage (150 - 10) = minimum 5 thermal shock hits
attack guardian with ice wand
attack guardian with fire wand
attack guardian with ice wand
attack guardian with fire wand
attack guardian with ice wand

# Second golem destroyed (10 + 30*5 = 160 damage > 150 HP)
# Both golems should be destroyed
look

# Verify path is clear - can now access observatory
go up
