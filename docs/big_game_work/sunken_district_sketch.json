      "question": "How difficult should the deep archive be to access?",

      "id": "Q-SUNKEN-4",
      "question": "How much time does training take?",

      "id": "Q-SUNKEN-5",
      "question": "How does player learn Delvan's survival status before committing?",

      "resolution": "Valid 'cold efficiency' path. Player can reach archive with advanced swimming (requires saving Garrett first for lessons, creating minimum engagement) or by finding/buying enchanted bubble elsewhere.

      "resolution": "Five is sufficient. The fragment list is designed so some come from rescued NPCs (creating value in those relationships) and some from exploration. Player needs 3 of 5, allowing for partial completion of rescue goals."
