      "question": "What if player abandons Sira and Elara finds out?",
      "resolution": "If player confesses: Elara is disappointed (-2 trust) but respects honesty. 'She waited for help that never came. I thought you understood what healing means.' Advanced herbalism teaching delayed but not permanently denied. If Elara learns from others (travelers, Echo's influence spreading through gossip, Sira herself if she survives): Much worse consequences (-3 trust). 'You let her suffer and said nothing to me? I don't know you at all.' Advanced herbalism permanently denied. Elara becomes cold and transactional. (Note: this applies regardless of branding status)"
