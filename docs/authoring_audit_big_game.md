**By Entity Type**:
- **NPCs (42 total)**: 21 with llm_context (50%), 21 missing (50%)
  - 13 well-authored with complete state coverage (31%)
  - 8 sparse base traits or partial state coverage (19%)
  - 21 missing llm_context entirely (50%)

## State Fragment Coverage Gap - CRITICAL FINDING

**Discovery Date**: 2025-12-30

Many NPCs have state machines but are **missing state_fragments** for some or all states. This prevents state-driven narration from working properly.

### Gap Analysis
- **48 total state_fragments missing** across 15 NPCs
- Each missing state_fragment needs 5-8 descriptive traits
- **Estimated effort**: 240-384 additional traits just for state coverage

### NPCs with Missing State Fragments

**Critical Gaps (no state_fragments at all)**:
- camp_leader_mira: 4 missing states
- damaged_guardian: 4 missing states
- gate_guard: 3 missing states
- merchant_delvan: 4 missing states
- npc_sporeling_1/2/3: 4 missing states each (12 total)
- sailor_garrett: 4 missing states
- the_archivist: 3 missing states
- the_echo: 5 missing states
- waystone_spirit: 3 missing states

**Partial Gaps (some state_fragments exist but incomplete)**:
- bear_cub_1: missing "dead" state
- bear_cub_2: missing "dead" state
- dire_bear: missing "dead" state
- spider_matriarch: missing "wary", "neutral", "allied" states (has only "hostile", "dead")

### Why This Matters
Without complete state_fragment coverage, the narrator model cannot properly describe NPCs as they transition through their state machine states. This undermines the entire purpose of state-driven narration.

---

## Authoring Effort Estimate

### NPCs (42 total)
- **Expand sparse base traits** (8 NPCs with 4 traits): ~2 traits each = **16 new traits**
- **Add missing state_fragments** (15 NPCs): 48 states × 5-8 traits = **240-384 new traits** ← **CRITICAL**
- ~~**Convert narrative-only** (5 NPCs)~~ → ✅ COMPLETED (180 traits added)
- **Create from scratch** (21 NPCs):
  - 10 with state machines: ~6 base + 20-32 state traits = ~260-380 traits
  - 11 without state machines: ~6 base = ~66 traits
  - Subtotal: **~326-446 traits**

**Total NPC traits needed**: ~582-846 traits

### Items (61 total)
- **Quest-critical** (~15 items): 6 traits + 3 state_variants = **~135 trait-equivalents**
- **Tools & equipment** (~10 items): 5 traits + 3 state_variants = **~80 trait-equivalents**
- **Consumables** (~20 items): 5 traits + 2 state_variants = **~140 trait-equivalents**
- **Gear & crystals** (~10 items): 5 traits + 3 state_variants = **~80 trait-equivalents**
- **Interactive objects** (~6 items): 6 traits + 3 state_variants = **~54 trait-equivalents**

**Total Item traits needed**: ~489 trait-equivalents (305 base traits + ~184 state_variant descriptions)

### Locations (45 total)
- **Hub & quest locations** (~15 locations): 8 traits + 3 state_variants = **~165 trait-equivalents**
- **Wilderness & regions** (~30 locations): 6 traits + 2 state_variants = **~240 trait-equivalents**

**Total Location traits needed**: ~405 trait-equivalents (270 base traits + ~135 state_variant descriptions)

### Grand Total
**Approximately 1,476-1,740 descriptive elements** needed across all 148 entities:
- NPCs: 582-846 traits
- Items: ~489 trait-equivalents
- Locations: ~405 trait-equivalents

**Note**: "Trait-equivalents" includes both trait lists and state_variant descriptions

## Recommended Authoring Strategy

### Phase 1: Upgrade Existing NPCs (Lower Effort)
1. ~~Convert narrative-only NPCs (5) - restructure to trait lists~~ ✅ COMPLETED
2. **Fill state_fragment gaps (15 NPCs) - add missing state descriptions** ← **NEXT** ⚠️ CRITICAL
3. Expand sparse NPCs (10 NPCs) - add 2-4 base traits each

**Rationale**: State fragment gaps break state-driven narration completely. Without proper state_fragments, NPCs with state machines cannot be properly narrated as they change states. This is more critical than expanding sparse base traits.

### Phase 2: Critical Path Entities (Gameplay Impact)
1. Quest-critical NPCs without llm_context
2. Combat enemies (sporelings, fish, etc.)
3. Key quest items (wands, journals, crystals)
4. Major locations (nexus, sanctums, puzzle rooms)

### Phase 3: Supporting Cast (Completeness)
1. Merchant/service NPCs
2. Flavor items
3. Transitional locations

### Automation Opportunities
- Template generation for similar entities (e.g., frost_wolf_1 and frost_wolf_2 can share structure)
- LLM-assisted trait generation with human review
- Bulk conversion scripts for narrative-only → trait list pattern

---

## ~~Pattern Standardization Required~~ - ✅ COMPLETED

~~**Decision needed**: Should we convert narrative-only NPCs to trait-list pattern, or keep both?~~

**Decision Made & Implemented**: Converted all narrative-only NPCs to trait-list pattern
- ✅ All 5 narrative-only NPCs (golems, salamanders) now use trait-list pattern
- ✅ Trait lists give narrator more compositional freedom
- ✅ Consistent structure across all NPCs
- ✅ All new authoring uses trait-list pattern
